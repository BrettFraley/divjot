Div Jot
======

awesomely plain live web editor, akin to a napkin

This project name has changed from napkin to Div-Jot because it
seems there's a Mozilla project named napkin, that happens to be
a webdev editor tool as well.

###Div Jot is for saving time, having fun, and:  
* Jotting down ideas in HTML, CSS, and JS.
* Immediate visual gratification for fast prototyping.
* Quickly trying out example code fast.
* Developing single web page components, UI elements, or entire sites.
* Cross browser, device, and screen responsive testing.
* Peace of mind, through clarifying moments of, "yes!".
 
###Development goals:
####Versions
* Local app
* Single JS file to load Napkin 'on top of' most live websites.
* Chrome and Firefox extensions.
 
####Features
* Import popular libraries and fonts with simple checkbox menu.
* Load or unload additional features as plugins.

Note: All available imports, plugins, settings, and documentation will be in the wiki (not done).

This project is very new and will see many changes. However, the ideals behind Div Jot are of pure simplicity. Avoiding features and additional code complexity IS a feature. So, once the basic functions and UI are completed, additional features will be made accessible through the plugins, imports, and settings buttons.
