###Napkin is for saving time, having fun, and:  
* Quickly jotting down ideas in HTML, CSS, and JS.
* Immediate visual gratification for fast prototyping.
* Learning and trying out webdev example code fast.
* Developing single web page components, UI elements, or entire sites.
* Cross browser, device, and screen responsive testing.
* Peace of mind, though clarifying moments of, "yes!".
 
###Development goals:
####Versions
* Local app
* Single JS file to load Napkin 'on top of' most live websites.
* Chrome and Firefox extensions.
 
####Features
* Import popular libraries and fonts with simple checkbox menu.
* Load or unload additional features as plugins.

Note: All available imports, plugins, settings, and documentation will be in the wiki (not done).

This project is very new and will see many changes. However, the ideals behind Napkin are of pure simplicity. Avoiding features and additional code complexity IS a feature. So, once the basic functions and UI are completed, new stuff is implemented and accessible through the plugins, imports, and settings buttons (which are not yet implemented).
