#divjot

awesomely plain live web editor, akin to a napkin

### Get started
Simply clone or download it, and open index.html in a browser.

####Div Jot is for saving time, having fun, and:  
- Jotting down ideas in HTML, CSS, and JS.
- Fast prototyping.
- Trying out example code.
- Developing and A/B testing web apps and sites.
- Cross browser, device, and screen responsive testing.
 
###Development goals:
There's more default features to complete.
Then there will be the following versions of the codebase released:
- Local app
- Single JS file to load divjot 'on top of' live websites.
- Web browser extensions.
